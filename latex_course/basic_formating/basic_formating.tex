\section{Introduction}
Basic formating tags in \LaTeX

\subsection{Text Formating}

All the things you want to do, and sometimes should .. emphasis on SOMETIMES.

\textbf{Bold Formating} is only between the curly braces.

\emph{Italics Formating}

\underline{Underline Formating}

\subsection{Paragraph Formatting}

New paragraphs are automatically indented.

\noindent But sometimes you don't want them to be.

\section{Oddities}

Strange things I noticed.

\subsection{Misquoting}

This is how I would normally type 'single' and "double" quotes. Doesn't it look odd?

\noindent Use that \emph{other} quote key you've probably neve used before to make it better.

\noindent See my new `single' quotes, and ``double" quotes? Ahh, that's better.

\section{Conclusion}

These are  just a few of the basic elements in a \LaTeX file. We'll look at many more through this course.
